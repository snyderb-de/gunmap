# gunMap

a project to learn data viz via deck.gl

## Getting Started

- You need npm installed, version shouldn't matter.
- Firebase Project setup is a good idea for easy deploy and linking to...
- Obtain a Google Maps Javascript API Key
- git is useful too, so a .gitignore is a good idea and you can get one [here](https://gitignore.io) and is a good idea to add your OS (or all three) as well as NPM and then create your ignore file, then paste that into it. See "Installing" for steps.
